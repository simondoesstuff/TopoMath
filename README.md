## TopoMath

A website designed in correspondence with my calculus professor that generates and manipulates procedural terrain based on a single mathematical expression in real-time.

Inspired by reverse engineering procedural terrain generation in Minecraft. TopoMath aims to connect Minecraft to calculus in the classroom.

Based on SvelteKit and TailwindCSS. 3D rendering uses ThreeJS. Generation uses simplex noise from NoiseJS. Additionally using MathQuill and MathJS for expression handling.
